        <p>I began my seven years of teaching experience as a life sciences teacher at Aurora Hills Middle School.
        I was exposed to a student population that tested below 3% proficient at grade-level in both reading and math… yikes!
        I learned a lot from that year, including cultivating a deep understanding of educational pedagogy and a commitment to fostering inclusive, equitable learning environments, and took my experience to Rangeview High School the following year, where I taught physics.</p>

        <p>I taught physics at Rangeview High School for six years where, in addition to collaborating with other teachers both vertically and horizontally at other high schools and middle schools to ensure our students were being set up for success, I collaborated with district leaders when redesigning the physics curriculum to align with new state standards.
          I helped revise the quarterly maps by advocating strongly for the inclusion of weekly projects and/or experiments in addition to spiraling concepts that were to be revisited and built upon several times throughout the year.
          My main goals as a teacher were to see students succeed and be engaged; by my sixth year, I saw over 90% growth in my students and had received highly-effective evaluations from my principal.</p>

        <p>A key aspect of my teaching philosophy is the belief that education should reflect and respect the diverse identities and experiences of students.
          I like to use real-world problems and examples from various cultures and that appeal to the different interests of my students to illustrate complex scientific concepts, making the material more relatable and accessible.
          Common examples include tailoring daily warm-ups to include culturally relevant topics, such as calculating the velocity of Lionel Messi’s penalty kicks or calculating the trajectory of Steph Curry’s long distance 3’s.
          By integrating culturally relevant examples and materials, I have seen firsthand how this approach can ignite students’ curiosity and drive their academic success.</p>
